Today I went through [this tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to create a Next.js app.

I learned how to:

- Create a Next.js App
- Navigate between pages
- Create assets, metadata, and CSS
- Pre-rendering data and Data fetching
- Create dynamic routes
- Create API routes
- Deploy the app to Vercel from Github
